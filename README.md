# Webull-Case-Study

 
  

 

## Results

  Webull hasn't had as big of an impact in the investment management sector as its competitors, but for the short period of time they have been around, they have acquired over 5 million downloads of their app. They have recently included a desktop version. For their consumers, they've added cryptocurrency as a trade option. They are constantly adjusting to consumers wants and well as needs. Their most fierce competitor, Robinhood, with the same zero commission policy have lost thousands of clients due to lack of customer service.
  
## Recommendations

  There is very little that Webull doesn't offer. However, there are some sophisticated day traders that need level 2 trading for quicker transactions. These highly active traders need direct market access, which is not available in the app. Having this coded into the app would acquire more clients as well as entice lower level traders to use their research features and become day traders over time. This continual use of the app would also bring in more money per client to use for trading. It won't be necessary to obtain new technology, Webull can just use their Google Tag Manager to incorporate the newer codes.
