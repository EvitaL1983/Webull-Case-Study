# Webull-Case-Study

 
  
## Business Activities

  Wang opened the company with the global market in mind. “Our goal is to enable global investors, not just those in China, to diversify their portfolios by investing overseas,” said Wang. “In many countries, there are only limited options for domestic investors who really want access to a much wider market. Providing real-time data and localized services will produce huge business opportunities in the industry.” Wang also knew there was a big market with the millennials. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, Millennials now reached 72.1 million which has surpased Generation X at 65.2 million people. Of those millennials 93% owned a smartphone. Wang came into the U.S. market knowing that the general public needed a research-heavy, user-friendly interface that they could try out investing or just learn. They have taken their app a step further by adding paper-trading. You can use $1,000,000.00 of your fake money and create a portfolio. If you learn well enough, then use real money and trade with confidence! Having a mobile app, it was easy to cut initial investment costs of having a brick-and-mortar offices. There was no need to hire investment advisors. The app did it all!! To keep the mobile and now desktop version operating Wang uses Jquery, NGINX, Google Ananlytics, and Google Tag Manager.  

## Landscape

    The FinTech domains of investment management and robo-advisory has been growing exponentially in these past 5-10 years. A.I. is becoming omnipresent in todays investing, manual efforts are continuosly being eliminated. Work traditionally done by humans are being replaced by machines. The Artificial Intelligence algorithims help look through data ananlytics to help make quicker and proper trading decisions. Using the Artificial Intelligence in apps helps users, through their cell phones, make trading decisions on the move. The current players in investment management and robo-advisory were enlightened by Charles Darwin. It is not the strongest of the species that survies, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change! Webull has only been actively trading for 3 years now, but they are just as strong as their competitors. The consumers have plenty to choose from. RobinHood is the closest in comparison to Webull, but there are also Acorn, Stash, Motif, E*Trade, You Invest by J.P. Morgan, and several more. Those companies that have decided to stay brick-and mortar only have become obsolete. 

## Results

  Webull hasn't had as big of an impact in the investment management sector as its competitors, but for the short period of time they have been around, they have acquired over 5 million downloads of their app. They have recently included a desktop version. For their consumers, they've added cryptocurrency as a trade option. They are constantly adjusting to consumers wants and well as needs. Their most fierce competitor, Robinhood, with the same zero commission policy have lost thousands of clients due to lack of customer service.
  
## Recommendations

  There is very little that Webull doesn't offer. However, there are some sophisticated day traders that need level 2 trading for quicker transactions. These highly active traders need direct market access, which is not available in the app. Having this coded into the app would acquire more clients as well as entice lower level traders to use their research features and become day traders over time. This continual use of the app would also bring in more money per client to use for trading. It won't be necessary to obtain new technology, Webull can just use their Google Tag Manager to incorporate the newer codes.
