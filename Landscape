## Landscape

< The FinTech domains of Webull are investment management and robo-advisory. 

< Both domains have been growing exponentially in these past 5-10 years. 

< The biggest factor for this growth is Artificial Intelligence

< A.I. is becoming omnipresent in todays investments, manual efforts are continuosly being eliminated.

< Work traditionally done by humans are being replaced by machines.

< The Artificial Intelligence algorithims help look through data ananlytics to help make quicker and proper trading decisions.

< Using the Artificial Intelligence in apps helps users, through their cell phones, make trading decisions on the move.

< The current players in investment management and robo-advisory were possibly enlightened by Charles Darwin. 

< **It is not the strongest of the species that survies, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change!**

< Webull has only been actively trading for 2 years now, but they are just as strong as their competitors.

< RobinHood is the closest in comparison to Webull, but there are also Acorn, Stash, Motif, E*Trade, and You Invest by J.P. Morgan.

< Robinhood had been around for 12+ years, however with the same incentive of zero commissions and a better research platform, Webull is gaining ground.

< There are few companies that have decided to stay brick-and mortar, unfortunately they will soon become obsolete.
